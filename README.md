# MathsWatch-Bot
A Bot which completes questions in the "my progress" tab for MathsWatch, allowing you to get enough points to get first on the leaderboards.

It can currently get 1532 total points as of 07/06/23 and takes ~26 minutes to fully complete

## Installation
You can either:
Download the exe from the releases
or clone the repository

### Downloading the EXE
1. Go to releases and click the latest build
2. Unzip the folder after download
3. Click on the EXE

### Cloning the Repo
1. Clone the repo whichever way you wish
2. If you use the dev build, uncomment the functions you wish to use in Primary()
3. Install the reqirements with pip -r (Path to requirements.txt)
4. Run GUI.py and the program should start properly

## Notes
This **CANNOT** do your homework (unless it is to get x amount of marks in any way possible), it doesn't work like that and implementing it would take some time.

All tests are currently done on a 1920x1080 screen, being on a smaller screen resolution or windowing the program may cause problems as the menu bar squishes.

If you wish, you can change your leaderboard name to Anonymous, follow the guide underneath if you are interested.
